# Learning-Java-TypeScript

I created this repository simply because I wanted to do something with node.js(main: javascript, typescript)!  
There are other repositories, [Py-Something](https://github.com/bella2391/Py-Something.git) for learning.  

## Description of each directory

- `learning`:
 Result of reading quoting link or learning cmd.
- `official`:
 Result of learning [TypeScript-HandBook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html).
- `src`:
 Result of learning web development by mainly using pkg: web-pack.
