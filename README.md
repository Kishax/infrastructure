# NodeTs-Something
I created this repository simply because I wanted to do something with node.js(main: typescript)!<br>
There are other repositories, [Py-Something](https://github.com/bella2391/Py-Something.git), [NodeJs-Something](https://github.com/bella2391/Node-Js-Something.git) and [Js-Something](https://github.com/bella2391/Js-Something.git).
