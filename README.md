# FMCWebApp

## Description

This project is actually in use on the [FMC web](https://keypforev.f5.si/dev/).  
It is for FMC developers to collaborate on web development.  

## Column

This repository is based on [todoapp](https://github.com/bella2391/Learning/tree/js/ts), which I first developed in typescript.  
If anyone is interested, please refer to [”Introduction to Creating Web Applications with Node.js”](https://zenn.dev/wkb/books/node-tutorial).

## My Wish

I need like-minded developers/supporters/adviser, if you are interested in doing css, html main, or writing server code in node.js, please contact [me](https://github.com/bella2391).
