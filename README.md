# Learning-Java-TypeScript

I created this repository simply because I wanted to do something with node.js(main: javascript, typescript)!  
There are other repositories, [Learning-Rust](https://github.com/bella2391/Learning-Rust) for learning.  

## Description

The `express` module was used to host the server environment on the back end, and the `webpack` module was used to develop on the front end for differentiation.

## Note

For safety, `typescript` is used in the production environment.
